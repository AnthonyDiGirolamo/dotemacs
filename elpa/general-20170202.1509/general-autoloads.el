(autoload 'general-define-key "general" "\
The primary key definition function provided by general.

PREFIX corresponds to a prefix key and defaults to none. STATES corresponds to
the evil state(s) to bind the keys in. Non-evil users should not set STATES.
When STATES is non-nil, `evil-define-key' will be used. Otherwise `define-key'
will be used. Evil users may also want to leave STATES nil and set KEYMAPS to
a keymap such as `evil-normal-state-map' for global mappings. KEYMAPS defaults
to `global-map'. Note that STATES and KEYMAPS can either be a list or a single
symbol. If any keymap does not exist, the keybindings will be deferred until
the keymap does exist, so using `eval-after-load' is not necessary with this
function.

If NON-NORMAL-PREFIX is specified, this prefix will be used for emacs and insert
state keybindings instead of PREFIX. This argument will only have an effect if
'insert and/or 'emacs is one of the STATES or if 'evil-insert-state-map and/or
'evil-emacs-state-map is one of the KEYMAPS. Alternatively, GLOBAL-PREFIX can be
used with PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX to bind keys in all states under a
specified prefix. Like with NON-NORMAL-PREFIX, GLOBAL-PREFIX will prevent PREFIX
from applying to insert and emacs states. Note that these keywords are only
useful for evil users.

INFIX can be used to append a string to all of the specified prefixes. This is
potentially useful when you are using GLOBAL-PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX so
that you can sandwich keys in between all the prefixes and the specified keys in
MAPS. This may be particularly useful if you are using default prefixes in a
wrapper so that you can add to them without needing to re-specify all of them.
If none of the other prefix arguments are specified, INFIX will have no effect.

If PREFIX-COMMAND is specified, a prefix keymap/command will be created using
`define-prefix-command' as long as the symbol specified is not already bound (to
ensure that an existing prefix keymap is not overwritten if the
`general-define-key' function is re-evaluated). All prefixes will then be bound
to PREFIX-COMMAND. PREFIX-MAP and PREFIX-NAME can additionally be specified and
are used as the last two arguments to `define-prefix-command'.

Unlike with normal key definitions functions, the keymaps in KEYMAPS should be
quoted (this makes it easy to check if there is only one keymap instead of a
list of keymaps).

MAPS will be recorded for later use with `general-describe-keybindings'.

(autoload 'general-create-definer "general" "\
A helper macro to create key definitions functions.

It has a positional argument for KEYMAPS. It acts the same as
`general-define-key', and ARGS can contain keyword arguments in addition to
keybindings. This can basically act as a drop-in replacement for `define-key',
and unlike with `general-define-key', if KEYMAPS is a single keymap, it does
not need to be quoted.

(autoload 'general-simulate-keys "general" "\
Create a function to simulate KEYS.
If EMACS-STATE is non-nil, execute the keys in emacs state. Otherwise simulate
the keys in the current context (will work without evil). KEYS should be a
string  given in `kbd' notation. It an also be a list of a single command
followed by a string of the keys to simulate after calling that command. If
DOCSTRING is given, it will replace the automatically generated docstring. If
NAME is given, it will replace the automatically generated function name. NAME
should not be quoted.

\(fn KEYS &optional EMACS-STATE DOCSTRING NAME)" nil t)

(autoload 'general-key-dispatch "general" "\
Create a function that will run FALLBACK-COMMAND or a command from MAPS.
MAPS consists of <key> <command> pairs. If a key in MAPS is matched, the
corresponding command will be run. Otherwise FALLBACK-COMMAND will be run with
the unmatched keys. So, for example, if \"ab\" was pressed, and \"ab\" is not
one of the key sequences from MAPS, the FALLBACK-COMMAND will be run followed by
the simulated keypresses of \"ab\". Prefix arguments will still work regardless
of which command is run. This is useful for binding under non-prefix keys. For
example, this can be used to redefine a sequence like \"cw\" or \"cow\" in evil
but still have \"c\" work as `evil-change'. If TIMEOUT is specified,
FALLBACK-COMMAND will also be run in the case that the user does not press the
next key within the TIMEOUT (e.g. 0.5).

NAME and DOCSTRING are optional keyword arguments. They can be used to replace
the automatically generated name and docstring for the created function and are
potentially useful if you want to create multiple, different commands using the
same FALLBACK-COMMAND (e.g. `self-insert-command').

When INHERIT-KEYMAP is specified, all the keybindings from that keymap will be
inherited in MAPS.

WHICH-KEY can also be specified, in which case the description WHICH-KEY will
replace the command name in the which-key popup. Note that this requires a
version of which-key from after 2016-11-21.

A helper function to create vim-like wrappers over `general-define-key'.
The function created will be called NAME and will have the keymaps default to
KEYMAPS or the states default to STATES. If DEFAULT-TO-STATES is non-nil,
:states STATES will be used. Otherwise :keymaps KEYMAPS will be used. This can
be overriden later by setting the global `general-vim-definer-default'
