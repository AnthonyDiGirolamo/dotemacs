;;; Commentary:

;; A way to insert text snippets from an org-mode file.  The org-mode file in
;; question is defined in `yankpad-file' and is set to "yankpad.org" in your
;; `org-directory' by default.  In this file, each heading specifies a snippet
;; category and each subheading of that category defines a snippet.  This way
;; you can have different yankpads for different occasions.
;;
;; If you have yasnippet installed, yankpad will try to use it when pasting
;; snippets.  This means that you can use the features that yasnippet provides
;; (tab stops, elisp, etc).  You can use yankpad without yasnippet, and then the
;; snippet will simply be inserted as is.
;;
;; You can also add keybindings to snippets, by setting an `org-mode' tag on the
;; snippet.  The last tag will be interpreted as a keybinding, and the snippet
;; will then be inserted into `yankpad-map'.  `yankpad-map' is not bound to any
;; key by default.
;;
;; Another functionality is that snippets can include function calls, instead of
;; text.  In order to do this, the snippet heading should have a tag named
;; "func".  The snippet name could either be the name of the elisp function that
;; should be executed (will be called without arguments), or the content of the
;; snippet could be an `org-mode' src-block, which will then be executed when
;; you use the snippet.
;;
;; If you name a category to a major-mode name, that category will be switched
;; to when you change major-mode.  If you have projectile installed, you can also
;; name a categories to the same name as your projecile projects, and they will
;; be switched to when using `projectile-find-file'.
;;
;; To insert a snippet from the yankpad, use `yankpad-insert'.  If you need to
;; change the category, use `yankpad-set-category'.  Here's an example of what
;; yankpad.org could look like:

;;; Yankpad example:

;; ** Snippet 1
;;
;;    This is a snippet.
;;
;; ** Snippet 2
;;
;;    This is another snippet
;;    \* Org-mode doesn't like lines beginning with *
;;    Typing \* at the beginning of a line will be replaced with *
;;
;; * Category 2
;; ** Snippet 1
;;
;;    This is yet another snippet, in a different category.
;; ** Snippet 2        :s:
;;
;;    This snippet will be bound to "s" in yankpad-map.  Let's say you bind
;;    yankpad-map to f7, you can now press "f7 s" to insert this snippet.
;;
;; ** magit-status          :func:
;; ** Run magit-status      :func:m:
;;    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;    (magit-status)
;;    #+END_SRC
