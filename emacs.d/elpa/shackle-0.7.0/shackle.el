(defcustom shackle-rules nil
  "Association list of rules what to do with windows.
Each rule consists of a condition and a property list.  The
condition can be a symbol, a string or a list of either type.  If
it's a symbol, match the buffer's major mode.  If it's a string,
match the name of the buffer.  A list of symbols or strings
requires a match of any element as described earlier for its
type.  Use the following option in the property list to use
regular expression matching on a buffer name:

:regexp and t

A default rule can be set up with `shackle-default-rule'.
To make an exception to `shackle-default-rule', use the condition
you want to exclude and either not use the key in question, use a
different value or use a placeholder as key.

The property list accepts the following keys and values:

:select and t

Make sure the window that popped up is selected afterwards.
Customize `shackle-select-reused-windows' to make this the
default for windows already displaying the buffer.

:inhibit-window-quit and t

Modify the behaviour of `quit-window' to not delete the window.
This option is recommended in combination with :same, but can be
used with other keys like :other as well.  Customize
`shackle-inhibit-window-quit-on-same-windows' to make this the
default for every buffer that was displayed by switching to it in
the same window.

:ignore and t

Ignore the request of displaying a buffer completely.  Note that
this does *not* inhibit preceding actions such as creation or
update of the buffer in question.

:other and t

Reuse the other window if there's more than one window open,
otherwise pop up a new window.  Can be used with :frame to do the
equivalent with the other frame and a new frame.

:popup and t

Pop up a new window instead of reusing the current one.

:same and t

Don't pop up any window and reuse the currently active one.

:align and t or either of 'above, 'below, 'left and 'right

Align the popped up window at any of the specified sides or the
default size (see `shackle-default-alignment') by deleting all
other windows, then restore the window configuration after the
window has been \"dealt\" with by either burying its buffer or
deleting the window.

:ratio and a floating point value between 0 and 1

Use this option to specify a different ratio than the default
value of 0.5 (see `shackle-default-ratio').

:frame and t

Pop to a frame instead of window."
